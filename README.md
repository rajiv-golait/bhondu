> *a birthday gift that's basically a whole vibe*

## what even is this?

so like, this is a birthday gift webpage that takes you on a lil journey through different aesthetics. starts off all dark and mysterious (stranger things vibes) and then BAM! transitions into this wholesome anne with an e moment. it's basically an experience™.

## the journey 🎭

1. **the upside down** - dark, mysterious, a lil spooky. you gotta enter the magic word to proceed (no spoilers tho)
2. **avonlea vibes** - soft, warm, cottagecore energy. cards that tell a story with beautiful backgrounds
3. **celebration time** - the grand finale with confetti and all the good stuff

## tech stack (but make it casual)

- pure HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks, we're keeping it real)
- some sick animations and transitions
- lottie animations for that extra ✨sparkle✨
- custom color palettes inspired by stranger things & anne with an e
- background music to set the mood
